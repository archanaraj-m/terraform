## Can you explain branching strategy followed by your organization
* A branching strategy helps define how the delivery team functions and how each feature, improvement, or bug fix is handled. It also reduces the complexity of the delivery pipeline by allowing developers to focus on developments and deployments only on the relevant branchesâ€”without affecting the entire product.
* we will use GIT FLOW -Branching Stratagy

1. master 
2. release
3. devopler

## What is a pull request?
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
If my code is executed i send pull request to the manager, manager check that code if he satisfied with that code and that code is correctly he can merge it in main repository.
